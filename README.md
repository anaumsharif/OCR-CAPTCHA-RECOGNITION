# OCR 
Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image 
This technology can be used for solving CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) automatically.
CAPTCHAs are automated tests to tell computers and humans apart. They are designed to be easily solvable by humans, but unsolvable by machines. With Convolutional Neural Networks these tests can also be solved automatically.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an image of text into a machine-readable text format. For example, if you scan a form or a receipt, your computer saves the scan as an image file. You cannot use a text editor to edit, search, or count the words in the image file.
However, you can use OCR to convert the image into a text document with its contents stored as text data.
